      Firstly, you need to care about our indicator that locale language buttons
      in editor settings tab. We can give you some hint about itðŸ˜€.
      <span style="color: red;">Red</span>
      indicator means, don't force too much this language, just for basic use,
      perhaps less. <span style="color: orange;">Orange</span> indicator is the
      language works fine, but we need to do more test. And finally white
      indicator means, you can use this language fully compatibility.

      <h2>Stand Up</h2>
      Then, you should choose correct language via editor settings tab. However,
      don't worry about to wrong choices. If you choose wrong language, our
      editor try to notify you with syntax error. Nevertheless, you may have
      unwittingly deploy your code, but don't worry you just get some errors. We
      expect you to follow some rules after choosing the right language. You can
      find these rules in the comment line at the beginning of the sample code.

      <h2>Break The Code</h2>
      Well... well... Let's write some code. After writing some clean code (we
      believe you), all you have to do is press the
      <i style="color: #007bff;">Deploy</i> button. Then, the page will slowly
      scroll down annnddd you will see the super, uber, cool kicket UUID. This
      UUID is custom made for you, it's coolðŸ˜Ž. Additionally, you can get an
      exist API via the <i style="color: #2bbbad">Exist API</i> button. However,
      this feature only works with Node JS for now.

      If everything went smooth until this stage, you can be proud of
      yourselfðŸ˜Ž. Now, if you like, you can use our small app to test your
      custom rest api. Also, you can get full link of your custom rest api and
      you can make calls from anywhere and you can share it with the person you
      want. We don't currently have an IP restriction, so everybody can call
      your super, uber, cool rest api.
